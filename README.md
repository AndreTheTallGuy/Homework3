## About
This is a password generator. It is also the Geniest password on the internet. What's that you say? That's not even a word, you say? Well all I can tell you is that I'm the only one to have made such a claim and therefore it is true.

## Features
After answering some prompts the user will find an automatically generated password. If the user is not happy with the password, a simple click of the "Get a new password" button with start the process all over again. 

The copy to clipboard feature is a bit more fickle in execution and is currently on vacation. 

## Struggles
The copy to clipboard feature is something I am still struggling with. I have the JS that will copy text if it is in a text input, but cannot get the password to generate in a text input. I have tried getElementById, ByClassName, and even ByTag, but I can't get the password to go into the textbox.
